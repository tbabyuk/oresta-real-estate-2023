        text: "I am more than happy to recommend Oresta Kisil as a qualified Real Estate Agent. Oresta assisted me in renting out my King West loft during the summer 2017. She has provided a full-fledged service and it has been a wonderful experience at every stage of the process. She has been very helpful and exceptionally resourceful, especially considering she organized everything while I was out-of-province. My apartment was rented in a very short time period and every detail has been taken care of promptly. Oresta has always been a pleasure to deal with and she's always been available for follow-ups and to obtain any information I needed. Amongst other  things, she was able to assist me in getting my apartment painted and professionally cleaned and didn't hesitate to use her personal contacts. I will definitely retain her services the next time around.",

        text: "Oresta Kisil has been my real estate agent for the purchase of two properties within the last few years. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for an efficient and professional service. With both purchases she was able to work with my schedule to see the properties of my choosing and made a few suggestions, which worked out very well for me at the end. She arranged for a home inspection and when there were issues to be addressed, Oresta handled them quickly and professionally, she also negotiated a substantial price reduction. She is a pleasure to deal with, great at figuring out what a person is looking for, and is there through every step of the whole experience. I would highly recommend working with Oresta for your next buy or sell!!",

        text: "I was only 24 when I was looking at my first home and was referred to another of realtors, one of them being Oresta. Choosing her to represent me in this important milestone is one of the best decisions I've ever made. Being a young age and inexperienced with home purchases, Oresta made the process very comfortable and ensured all grounds were covered. She went above and beyond in doing jobs that weren't considered her scope just to make sure everything was smooth for me. I still remember when Oresta took the initiative to see houses on my behalf without me asking with pictures and provided very insightful inputs that I wouldn't have otherwise known. She truly puts her clients' first, till this day she still keeps in touch with me to ensure everything is going well. She definitely has my business on my next purchase!",

I have been blessed to find my resident real estate guru and now friend! One of my transactions was quite emotional and the care with which Oresta handled things got me to the other end safe and sound. Oresta is organized, honest and trustworthy. I got regular updates on where things were, she arranged for trades people and staging and everything went well without a hitch. I needed to listen, trust and follow her guidance, while I was skeptical and afraid as is human nature, I am so glad that I let her lead the way. Thank you Oresta and if you are considering working with her, you would have made the right decision!",

She provided great advice and service, and even helped me find a handyman to do some small work on the aparment while I was away. A reliable tenant was found very fast, within 2 days of the listing going up. I will definitely use her services again for my future real estate needs.",
